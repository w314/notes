js, javaScript, async

# JS Async Programming

Async Code Needed When:
- making HTTP calls
- performing input/output operations
- dealing with client/server communications

## Async Techniquest in JavaScript
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async-Await


## Callbacks
> Callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.

- make sure the certain function does not execut until an other function has finished
- used when there is a need to inform the executing funtion on what is next when the async task completes

### `Callback Hell` or `Pyramid of Doom`
Problem arises when there is a lot of async task and callback within callback within callback has to be defined.

To overcome the disadvantes of callback Pormises was introduced.

## Promises

See `jsPromises.md`.

## Async Await
 See `jsAsyncAwait.md`.
