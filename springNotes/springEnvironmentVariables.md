# Properties In Spring Boot

[Baeldung Source](https://www.baeldung.com/properties-with-spring)

Putting an `application.properties` file under `src/main/resources` will be auto-detected by Spring Boot.

- we do not have to explicitely register the properties file
- nor do we have to provide a path for it
