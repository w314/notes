java, oop

- whenever a new object is created with teh `new` keyword all its instance variables are initialized to the default value of their types

What is the output of this code:
```java
class Trainee {
    int id;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Trainee trainee = null;
        System.out.println(trainee.id);
    }
}
```
It is a `runtime error`, it is not checked at compilation time.


## Relationships between classes

- Aggregation - has a
- Association - uses a  
- Inheritance -
